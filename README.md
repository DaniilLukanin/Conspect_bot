***Designed to help you study.***

About the project:

Our project is important, because in such unique subjects as: geography, physics, history, very original material is presented, which is not found in textbooks, and the 7th graders of our school do not have biology textbooks at all, information is taken exclusively from notes. Missing a class can be a big problem for students. And some notes contain unique information not provided in textbooks.

In the future, it is planned to add abstracts, as well as additional. materials for more items. Optimizing the code and adding all the extras. functions.
